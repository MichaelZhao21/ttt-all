# Tic Tac Toe in a lot of Languages

I'm refreshing my knowledge on programming languages! I will be creating a simple tic-tac-toe program in a ton of different languages! I've always found that if I could program this game in a language, then I could confidently say that I have a decent grasp on the language. Of course, something this simple won't cover the most advanced features of a language, but this is really just for an overview of the syntax and specific semantics for a language. I also plan on using some of the more popular libraries for that language, and many languages might even have a GUI! Tic-tac-toe I find to be a really great starter project as it will have variables, arrays, control statements, I/O, branching statements, some form of graphical output, and even AI (if you want).

If anyone has a suggestion on new languages I should add, just create a pull request and edit this file :)) - I'll attempt any interesting enough language, even esoteric ones hehe

## Goals

For each language, there are a few goals that I want to achieve:

1. Create some form of tic-tac-toe where 2 human players are able to play in a turn-based manner and end the game upon some winning condition
2. Add the ability to replay the game
3. Display the tic-tac-toe grid in some form, whether ASCII or through a graphics library
4. Create a simple AI that will block the player from winning, complete 3-in-a-rows, and attempt to play in optimal spots; the player should be able to choose who goes first
5. Create a [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) AI that will never lose :)
